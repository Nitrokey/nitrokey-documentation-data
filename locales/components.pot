This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the foreseeable future. Assuming a usage period of five years, is is already necessary to generate longer keys. However, longer RSA keys with 3072 bit or 4096 bit are significantly slower. For this reason the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 (resp. the integrated OpenPGP Card version 3.3) supports encryption by means of `elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`__. This method is considered to be just as secure with smaller ECC keys as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster."

Even if there is no evidence of back doors in the curves, using a certain curve can pose a question of trust. Fortunately the new Nitrokey Storage 2 and Pro 2 support two kind of curves, namely NIST and Brainpool.

Conversely, this process can be used to transmit the electrical signal from the diaphragm to the device, as with a microphone.
